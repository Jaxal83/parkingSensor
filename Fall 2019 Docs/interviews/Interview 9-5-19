  Overall Project
*****************************************************************************************************
- Could you give us an overview of the entire project?
 We need to create 5 prototype units attached to ceiling inside the garage that need to be able to sense when a car has parked and when a car has left the stall
 3 level garage – not going to touch the roof
 Put a unit on garage entrance to check when car enters the garage and one at exit for leaving, the remaining 3 are for stalls of our choice
 Display for whether the garage is full.
 Discrete event simulator – simulate the rest of the garage, create graphical simulation, real time or not? Up to us to decide.
 Don’t know about monitoring cars moving through the garage, probably not
 Generate the rest of the sensors in the simulation ~100 or so

Unit properties
 1 year on battery – need to measure currents, Dr Shovic has some tools for this and will provide them
 Maybe multiple types of sensor on the same unit – IR, photocell, sonar, motion
 Must detect a car, other vehicles such as motorcycles are optional
 LED connected that blinks – Red – no car, Green – car, idea is that it can be seen by cars looking to park
 Mesh Network – transmits to WLAN gateway located at the Den – Sigfox, LoRa – 2.1 GHz, 833 MHz, 433 MHz
 Processors – use what we like
 "Temperature sensor would be cool" – not essential
 Networking - major part – each sensor can act as the gateway for battery load balancing and in case the master one goes down – need to work it out
 4”x4”x4” size approx.
 Attachable to ceiling – cement or something
 Arduino may be enough for this
 Wonderware?
 QT?
 Able to reset everything

 Goal – minimize people’s time and effort to find parking spot
 App – optional if can be done do it

 Gateway – realistic behavior – car enters, time to go to first level, second level
 Tracking entrance and exit


- Title/name? Up to us

- Patent searches. Has this been done? How did they do it? 
  It has, do some research

- Timeline for class? When are our deliverables? 
  The entire system and hardware working for 5 units. We need to come up with milestones, design review. 
  Get through spec phase fast so we can work on hardware and coding faster to sort out issues when implementing.

- How often do we get to meet with our customer?
  didn’t answer, will be up to us to decide
  
- End users - who is expected to use the system? 
  People wanting to park in the garage
  
- How do they interact with the system? 
  The app
  
- Do we have a budget for this project? 
  ~$3000 – sensors, gateway, server, it's not expected to be an expensive project
  
- Which parking garage is this project being done on? 
  How large - number of stalls and levels, is it? 
  Believe it is the new one on 3rd street it is 3 level, we have to work out the number of stalls by actually visiting the site.

- Have the stalls been selected already, or will we get to visit the garage and pick? 
  We can pick what we want

- Will there be some advertising or advisory saying that monitoring will be going on once the sensors are installed? 
  Research if legal
 

************************************************************************************************************
   Hardware
************************************************************************************************************
- What base model should we use? esp8266? 
  Something with good power down modes

- What mesh network requires less power? Bluetooth? 
  Don’t know, we have to find out

- Does the entire garage need to be on a single brain? 
  One device will be the master at any time to send to the gateway

- Does the brain need to be in the garage? 
  No, it will be in the Innovation Den, do we need a bidirectional data link however? 
  battery level, synchronized clock, when to have them listen for transmission

- Deep sleep? 
  Heck yes

- Need to save any data from previous time of wakefulness? 
  Maybe/maybe not – eeprom

- How often does each unit need to report? How long does it take on average for a vehicle to enter and exit a stall? 
  Get data. – Go on field trip and find out

- How large are the units expected to be - Will they need to be inconspicuous? 
  4”x4”x4”, maybe put a black dome to look like a camera

- How do we physically secure these units? 
  Adhesive, tape
  
- Cost per base? Cost per satellite unit? How do we get component purchases approved? 
  Didn’t answer this, we have a $3000  budget to work with though.

- How do we sense the vehicles? Motorcycles and cars and trucks? Accuracy? What is the definition of stall being full? Lasers cost too much power?
  We must work it out ourselves
 
 
************************************************************************************************************* 
  Software
*************************************************************************************************************
- Does the data being sent from the sensors need encryption? 
  Confidentiality, Integrity, Authentication – PKI to prevent people forging the data, hashes, CRC
  Broadcasting for the sensors – how to determine which sensor gets to broadcast – wait for acknowledgement to be broadcasted? 
  Random fallback time for collisions, number seeding, assigning a serial number to base seeding off, secret – private key, system clock, uptime
  Must have Integrity and Authentication at the least

- App – IOS/Android, what is its purpose? 
  Either, allow people to see current state of parking garage

- Will hardware, software and licensing be provided to produce the apps – IOS – need apple computer hardware for Xcode, apple store dev license, iphone/ipad to test the software.
  We’ll get it all free – software, hardware didn’t mention, probably not due to the cost of istuff and our budget

- the simulation – is this going to be computationally expensive? 
  Would want to use a PC for it

- Are there any regulations that would limit our implementation? Tools, language, hardware, software regulations that exist? 
  Dr Shovic will obtain permission from the city. Do our own research for the rest
