CS 480 Meeting 9/12/19
Start Time 3:30 pm
End Time 4:45 pm
Members Present: Nikolai, Tyrel
Guest: Amanda from previous capstone project
Notetaker: Nikolai

Agenda:
Dr Sheldon is sick so no official class today. He and Dr Shovic arranged to have Amanda come in to
hear about the project and provide advice. Zane couldn't attend today.
Need to decide who does what for the next stage of the project. Zane is leaning towards doing the units.
Also have the mesh network and simulation.


Amanda talked about the logbook that she wrote and was more methodical about it early on
in the semester and started writing to it less as the deliverables became the focus.
Logbook entries should be more about talking about struggles that you had when working
and what you did to overcome them.

Talked about classes, in particular compiler design - expect to put 30-40 hrs a week on it.
Don't take it with CS481 since it will be too high a load.


After Amanda had to leave

Decided who will do what of the major parts of the project:
Hardware - Zane
Mesh Network - Nikolai
Simulation - Tyrel


To Do
Tyrel is going to set up a discord so that we can communicate quicker vs email
