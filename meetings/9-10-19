Agenda
Go over the documents – context diagram, use case diagram, abstract, schedule before submission.

Context and use diagrams feel like they are too brief, however they have everything that is expected on them.
The abstract looked good and was based off the first interview.
The schedule is a bit difficult to really work out right now since they are just ballpark guesses for when things are due.

The parking sensors
Do the units need to know their location in the garage e.g. each stall is labelled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 a unit is installed 
in that location and the unit knows it. It then transmits to the master unit with its location number and the 
system can update accordingly.

Possible sensors to use
Sound
Motion
IR
Light
We probably need a combination of the above and have at multiple positives to confirm a car is parked.

How long does a sensor need to be active to confirm that a car has parked in the stall, 
to account for a car pulling out immediately after pulling in.

What base unit to use – Arduino nano? Maybe use Bluetooth to communicate within the mesh 
network and then wifi to the innovation den afterwards.


Follow up Topics
Need to decide who does what for the next stage of the project.
